The reasons I chose this area:
 - it is one city in my country so I'm familiar with the language which users using to input data, it would be easier for me to find and correct the issues.
 - this is the biggest city of Vietnam so only this area has the OSM data greater than 50 MB as this project requires.
 - it is the 2nd city in the world's most dynamic cities (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/these-are-the-most-dynamic-cities-in-the-world-and-they-re-not-the-ones-you-d-expect/) so that i'd like to introduce to you, hope more tourists would come to visit it.
